# parallel-programming

Solutions of educational problems using the C and MPI library for additional knowledge of parallelism.

## Task 1 - Count the number of mismatched characters in two strings

Strings are randomized, user may set max string length in CLI.
Linear realization and parallel one are both executed and then compared.

## Task 2 - Matrix multiplication using tape horizontal scheme

Horizontal scheme splits only first matrix into strings, second matrix remains unchanged.
Matrices are randomized, user may set the size of each matrix in CLI.
Linear realization and parallel one are both executed and then compared.

## Task 3 - Shell sort with simple merge

Array is randomized and unsorted, user may set array length in CLI.
Linear realization and parallel one are both executed and then compared.
Tests are provided as well.
